lesson 9 - indexed families of sets
===

re: last day 

- cartesian product
  + axb = {(a,b) | a IN A and b IN B}

exercise #1:

1. let A ={ 1,2,3,4,5}, b = {1,3,5,7,9}, c = {a,b}
  - write out Cx(AnB) and (CxA)n(CxB)
  - prove or disprove: in general, cx(AnB) = (CxA)n(CxB).
2.  prove or disprove: (AxB)u(CxD) = (AuC)x(BuD).

Indexed families of sets (section 2.4)
---

when dealing with a large number of generally described sets, it is useful to work with indexed families.

- Suppose I want to descrive the set of all rational numbers with a given denominator that is between 0 and 1.
  + eg: 
  + S2 = {0,1/2,1}
  + ...

~~this family of sets~~ _Sets of this type_ can be denoted using an index, i as:
- Si = {j/i | j = 0,1,2,...,i-1,i} = {0, 1/i, 2/i,...,i-1/i, 1} = {j/i | j IN Z, 0 <= j <= i}
  + Textbook sometimes uses the char `alpha` or n instead of i
- to refer to the entire family of sets of this type, we could write, for example, 
  + {Si} for i going 1 to 100
    * The family of sets Si for i from 1 to 100
    * = {{0,1},{0,1/2,1},...,{0,1/100,2/100,...,99/100,1}}
    * `    S1      S2               S100` 
- We can also refer to a more specific group of sets using an index set, eg.
