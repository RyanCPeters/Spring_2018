Did your numbers surprise you? Why or why not? Were they higher or lower than expected?

I am not as surprised by the number of questions being asked as I am by the gender ratios of the two classes. Specifically, I'm surprised at how uneven the STMath 308 course is as compared to the STMath 300 course. 

Was there a difference in your different STEM classes if you're taking more than one?

Was there a particular person or group of people who primarily asked or answered questions? Where do they sit? Which gender do they present as?

Did your instructor(s) use techniques that required different students to ask or answer questions? If so, do you think they were successful? What evidence do you have to support your answer?
