CSS 290 Class Profile log


Starting on Thursday, 4/5, calculate the proportion of people in your STEM classes who present as a woman.
Keep track of how many of them ask and answer questions in class voluntarily vs. other students in the class (you should have a ratio for this as well).
Report your numbers and answer the following reflection questions:
Did your numbers surprise you? Why or why not? Were they higher or lower than expected?
Was there a difference in your different STEM classes if you're taking more than one?
Was there a particular person or group of people who primarily asked or answered questions? Where do they sit? Which gender do they present as?
Did your instructor(s) use techniques that required different students to ask or answer questions? If so, do you think they were successful? What evidence do you have to support your answer?
