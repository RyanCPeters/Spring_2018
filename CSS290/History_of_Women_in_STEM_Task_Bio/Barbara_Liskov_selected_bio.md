Barbara Liskov
Current status:
- Barbara Liskov is an American computer scientist currently working as a Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
- Barbara lead the design of the programing language, Argus, which she then built,with the help of a small team while at MIT. 
  + created between 1982 and 1988
- Barbara Liskov and her students created another programing language called CLU, between 1974 and 1975. While it did not find extensive use, it introduced many features that are used widely now, and is seen as a step in the development of object-oriented programming (OOP).
  + Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the Liskov substitution principle.
  + Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming stating that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.)
  + CLU is a programming language created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
  + The key addition was the concept of a cluster, CLU's type extension system and the root of the language's name (CLUster)
- in the School of Engineering's "electrical engineering and computer science department".
  + Barbara is an Institute Professor (the highest title that can be awarded to a faculty member at MIT) 
  + Also a Ford Professor of Engineering (we were not able to find a definition for this title) 
- She initially studied at University of California at Berkeley and earned a B.S. in Mathematics 
- At MIT,  precursor languages to modern object-oriented programming, and is currently working with MITâ€™s Programming Methodology Group on Byzantine Fault Tolerance. She believes a lot of her success in computer science was due to being remarkably prepared in math and science as well as availing herself of any opportunities that introduced her to the engineering world.

Back-story 
- Subsequently decided to work at the _**Mitre Corporation**_ rather than continue into grad school. 
  + at Mitre she discovered she had a natural aptitude for computer programming,
    * Went on to study at Stanford, where she eventually earned her Ph.D. in 1968. 
  + She returned to Mitre for 3 years before taking a position at MIT as a professor in their computer science program.
