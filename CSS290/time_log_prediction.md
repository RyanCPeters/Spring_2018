Prediction:

per day approximate expectations:

- sleeping: 
  + 5-7 hours, expected average of 6 hours.
- driving (including commute to school and travel to see friends/family)
  + commuting to school (2 days per week):
    * when driving, it takes me approximately .75 hours, both ways
      - expected total time on driving days: 1.5 hours
    * when bicycling, it takes me between .75 to 1.25 hours, both ways
      - expected total time on cycling days: 2 hours
  + drive time when visiting friends:
    * I generally don't have time during school to visit friends, but I'm including this category as a precaution.
      - for now, this category will be predicted at 0 hours.
- down-time (RnR):
  + When transitioning between homework subjects, I generally spend .25 to 1.5 hours looking into side topics that I found interesting, yet unrelated to the specific HW topic. This typically happens multiple times per day, every day of the week.
    * time spent: 3-5 hours (daily)
  + I don't watch much TV as I have a hard time getting into most popular television. But I will watch with my SO, as I generally enjoy being able to have conversations with her about what's happening in the shows she's currently into.
    * time spent: 0 - 2 hours (only 1-2 days a week though).
  + When I reach the point of feeling that I am spinning my wheels on a homework assignment, as a result of mental fatigue or just being physically tired, I play really simple games to help disconnect my mind from the homework topic as a part of calming myself before going to bed.
    * time spent: typically .5 - 1 hour.

1. How did your tracked time match with your expectations? Was there anything surprising?

Unfortunately, I failed very hard at remembering to check in on my time-logger app. I'm pretty bad about being mindful of my phone and messages in the first place, so remembering to update my time-logger was an unsurprising short-coming for me in this assignment. 

I tried to make sure that I wrote down the activities I did each day, in a spreadsheet, but my time sense has never been very accurate. I don't really know how to explain it, other than to say that I've spent my entire life experiencing the world in a similar fashion to how most people describe the come down from being high. I've always struggled with remembering where I put my wallet or keys, I have no sense of time while I'm focused on tasks that don't naturally translate into tasks that also relate to timed units (like cooking, or hobby activities).

2. How balanced is your life between work and other activities?


3. What is one obstacle/problem area to balancing or managing your time? How do you think you can change it?


4. What is one trick that youâ€™ve used to balance/manage your time that is successful, that maybe you can pass on to your peers?
