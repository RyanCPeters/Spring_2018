Hello Dr. Hill,

Thank you for organizing today's panel meeting. The panel's responses to the class's questions gave 
context for additional thought and questions. Speaking of, if you don't mind, I have a list of questions 
for the panel members that I'm interested in getting their feedback on.

A special notice regarding the change in context: 

  Several of the follow up questions were meant for specific panel members, as 
  those questions were in response to something that individual said during the session today; 
  however, because this email is now in a removed context from from when the initial statements 
  were shared, it may be difficult for any individual panel member to recreate that mental space 
  from earlier today on their own. 

  So it may be best if the questions are generified to the general panel body, where appropriate,
  instead of remaining directed at specific individuals.

That said, I've kept the questions formatted as being addressed to the individuals that inspired 
the question, should you want to review them for clarity or appropriateness in this removed context.

~~~~~~~          Follow up questions begin here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow up to question #1:
       
For Eva Cherry:
I was wondering if Eva would be willing to elaborate a bit on the cultural status for gender
equality in Germany around the time that Angela Merkel took office as Chancellor of Germany. 
Specifically, was it very different from what it is now? How different is it from what we see
here in the U.S.

Follow up to question #3:
Open to all panel members:

  There's a saying which seems to encapsulate the complexity and challenge of raising a child
  that I think bears significant relevance to the discussion we had about the balance of work
  and personal life:

   					"It takes a village to raise a child." 

  This saying shows a stark contrast to the nuclear family of modern western culture; do you feel 
  that the lack of communal involvement in the care for children is perhaps the "white elephant" 
  in the room when we talk about the issues surrounding the challenge of balancing work with 
  personal-life goals or responsibilities.


Follow up to question #4:

question for Dr. Atov:
  
As a follow up to the information you provided on the development of the 'Women in Engineering' 
group, would you say that the group you founded serves as a safe "jump-in" point for women 
new to STEM? 

Finding your bearings in the opportunities and resources offered by the IEEE can be dizzying at 
first. In some respects that initial shock can make membership feel less like an oportunity, 
and more like another tedius item on the long list of prerequisites to success. 


This begs another question: 
How do you handle the complexity of finding your feet when you are thrust into an environment 
that seems to have been built solely for the benefit of those already established in it?


question for Dr. Hillyard:

  Would you say that targetting gatekeeper positions would be an effective strategy for getting
  a jump start on your network of contacts and name familiarity in the professional circles you
  you associate with.



Follow to question #5:

  While we have this richly diverse array of skill sets from the panel, can we speak about
  how the different STEM fields structure their interview process? Do interviews for 
  Software Eng. positions differ in any specific way from:
    Electrical Engineer positions? 
    Data analysit positions?
    From Chemist positions?
